## My process

In this project, I was focusing on the logic of the app.

### Things I've done in this project that I haven't done before:

- Used SVG to make an animated loader
- Used a web worker, so the timer would also work when the tab is not in focus
- Dynamically imported a Next.js component (the modal)
- Switched theme using CSS variables

### Built with

- NextJS
- Sass
- React hook form
- SVG
- Web workers
- Typescript
